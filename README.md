# Debrief
In this course we will make a data visualization for De Volkskrant newspaper. We got some data to explore. The data was about parking cars in cities. I have to choose a topic which I think would make a great visualization. These datasets were given by RDW and are opensource. Data like parking area's, payment method area's and places where tickets can be bought. The first thing we have to do is clean the data, so clean up all the empty spaces for example. After that we have to visualize it using JavaScript and a library to make this work.
