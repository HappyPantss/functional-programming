# Debrief
In this course we will make a data visualization for the 'De Volkskrant' newspaper. We got some data to explore. The data is about parking and cars. I have to choose a topic which I think would make a great visualization. These datasets were given by RDW and are opensource. The RDW is a organization that takes care of the registration of motorized vehicles and driving licenses in the Netherlands.

Datasets with information like parking area's, payment method area's and places where tickets can be bought, can be found. 

The first thing we have to do is clean the data, so clean up all the empty spaces for example. After that we have to visualize it using JavaScript and a library (D3) to make something nice.

# Research questions
How are Park and Ride parking spaces have been added in the past few years?

I want to know why Park and Ride spaces are developed, why **you** should use them, and more.
